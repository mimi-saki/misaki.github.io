# What is a Spin Coater?

The spin coater is one of the three primary tools used by Irvine Hacker Fab students to coat and spin our own silicon wafers. Like what the name implies, the spin coater's job 
is to hold a silicon wafer in place while spinning to achieve an even layer of photoresist.

### Note Alert

> [!NOTE]
> ![](./spincoatercross.png) 
> This is our first working rendition of the spin coater. It is entirely 3D printed, making it accessible and easily replicable. The blue portion is the wafer chuck where the silicon
> wafer will sit on, while the orange piece is the rotary vaccum (responsible for rotating the chuck). We have a seperate pump and tube that connects to the spin coater which creates
> the actual suction.
